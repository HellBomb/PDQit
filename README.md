# PDQ IT
I have been using PDQ for about 2 years now but it took only days to fall in love with it. Its easy to use interface and powerful functionality makes it hands down one of the best tools in any windows administrators toolbox for system administrators of all skill levels. We have been able to combine PDQ Deploy, PDQ Inventory, and Active Directory to completely automate application installations based on Active Directory Security groups.

## Before We Get Started
I will be keeping this repo up to date with the latest versions of my PDQ Packagages but those may not represent the latest versions of software. With how easily it is to download the latest version of software and point it to the latest file I will leave making those updates to you.
